# demo-using-github
This is the first time I use github for my project. Before,my team usually code in our laptops and when we complete my task, we have to
merge our code together. In this time,error exactly appear and we must do it again. Therefore, we use github to save our project in repo
on internet. We can do on a source code and have checked all errors before updated to main code.
