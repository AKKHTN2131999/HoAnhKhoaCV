        \textit{I am an alumnus of the University of Natural Sciences (under the Vietnam National University, Ho Chi Minh City). My major is computer science. With my love for Artificial Intelligence, I have been constantly studying and working hard in this field. I have 1 year experience working with Chatbot. I hope that a suitable job in the not-too-distance future will continue to fuel my passion.}\\\\

            \begin{itemize}
                \item Improved LSW algorithm and increased 0.92 BLEU score.
                \item Optimize wnet2vec memory and training time and achieve better word embbedding efficiency.
                \item Cluster synsets (set of synonyms in Wordnet) and feed this information into word representation. Helps improve 1.55 BLEU.
                \item Framework: Torch
